# CS50-AI
For Harvard's CS50 Intro to Artificial Intelligence Course.

## Week0/Project0 - Search
### [Degrees](./Project0/degrees)
Breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two Hollywood actors and the movies they star in.
### [TicTacToe](./Project0/tictactoe)
An AI TicTacToe-player with pygame, using minimax. Experimental depth-limiting and alpha-beta pruning.

## Week1/Project1 - Knowledge
### [Knights](./Project1/knights)
Propositional logic puzzle solver for "Knights and Knaves" puzzles.
### [Minesweeper](./Project1/minesweeper)
AI Minesweeper-player with pygame using propositional logic.

## Week2/Project2 - Uncertainty
### [PageRank](./Project2/pagerank)
Based on Larry Page's PageRank system developed for prioritizing Google search results. Uses a sampling method based on Markov Chains, as well as an iterative method that recursively updates estimated pagerank values until convergence. 

### [Heredity](./Project2/heredity)
Uses unconditional probabilities of passing a trait from parent to child to guess the probabilities of a child having a certain trait, and how many genes they have.  Works with multiple family members, also calculating probabilities of having a specific number of genes related to a trait.

## Week3/Project3 - Optimization
### [Crossword](./Project3/crossword)
Uses the AC-3 arc consistency algorithm.

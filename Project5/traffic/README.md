In a separate file called README.md, document (in at least a paragraph or two) your experimentation process. What did you try? What worked well? What didn’t work well? What did you notice?

## What did I try?
**Test 1**
2DConv with 32 3x3 filters and relu activation, 2x2 max-pooling, no dropout layer, and flattening

**Test 2**
Identical to above, but with 128-unit Dense layer and Dropout with rate of 0.5


## Test Results
**Test 1:** 10656/10656 - 1s - loss: 0.0220 - acc: 0.9961
**Test 2:** 10656/10656 - 1s - loss: 0.6886 - acc: 0.9552
